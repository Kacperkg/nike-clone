# Development Guidance For This Project

## 🎯 Primary Goal
This project is a frontend-focused portfolio learning project.

The main career target is frontend engineering.

Backend and infrastructure work is used only to support frontend development and learning.

---

## 🧠 Coding Assistance Style

When helping with code, prioritize:

1. Clean architecture
2. Modern frontend patterns
3. Minimal complexity
4. Production-like structure
5. Maintainability

Avoid:
- Overengineering
- Unnecessary backend abstraction
- Experimental frameworks unless requested

---

## ⚡ Technology Stack Preferences

### Frontend (Primary Focus)
- TanStack Start
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS (minimal Nike-style design)
- React Query patterns
- Redux only when necessary

Frontend UI should follow:

- Minimalist fashion brand style
- Large whitespace
- Simple navigation
- High quality product presentation

---

### Backend (Support Role Only)
- Django REST Framework
- PostgreSQL database
- Admin panel product management
- Simple REST endpoints

Do not add complex backend logic unless explicitly requested.

---

### Infrastructure
- Docker for local development
- Simple deployment pipeline
- Avoid premature optimization

---

## 📦 Architecture Philosophy

Follow this data flow:

Database → REST API → Frontend Query Fetch → UI Rendering

Frontend should NOT directly handle database logic.

---

## 🎨 UI Design Philosophy

Target look:

- Modern ecommerce fashion website
- Nike-style minimal layout
- Black / white / grey palette
- Large hero sections
- Simple product grids

Avoid:
- Dashboard-style clutter
- Complex UI interactions early

---

## 🔥 Learning Priority Order

1. Frontend layout and product display
2. API integration
3. State management (React Query + small Redux usage)
4. Authentication (later stage)
5. DevOps deployment basics

---

## 🧩 Coding Help Style Request

If I ask for code help, provide:

- Context of problem
- Target feature
- Current folder/file structure if relevant

---

## ⚠️ Complexity Control Rule

If a solution is requested:

Prefer:
- Simple
- Working
- Maintainable

Over:
- Clever
- Over-abstracted
- Experimental

Unless explicitly asked.

---

## ❤️ Project Purpose

This project is primarily a learning portfolio and skill development exercise.

The implementation should remain practical and realistic for a student-level fullstack project.
